### Using GitHub Copilot in Codespaces

This repository includes a devcontainer configuration that installs GitHub Copilot extensions automatically when you open a Codespace.

Steps to use Copilot in a Codespace:

1. Open this repository in GitHub Codespaces (Code → Open with Codespaces → New codespace).
2. After the Codespace starts the devcontainer, the GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat extensions will be installed automatically.
3. Sign in to GitHub if prompted and enable Copilot (a subscription or organization seat may be required).
4. Use the Copilot panel (on the left or via View → Command Palette → Copilot) to ask natural-language commands. Note: Copilot Chat can provide code, suggest commands, and — when permitted — run or suggest terminal commands you can copy or execute.

If you prefer to run locally in VS Code, the repository includes a VS Code recommendation file (.vscode/extensions.json) to suggest installing the Copilot extensions.
