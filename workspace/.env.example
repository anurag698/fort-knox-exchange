# Base URL for the application. Used for constructing absolute URLs for API calls.
# In local development, this is typically http://localhost:3000 (or your port).
# In production, this should be your public domain (e.g., https://yourapp.com).

# FIREBASE ADMIN SDK (SERVER-ONLY)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For server-side operations (like in API routes or Server Actions), the Admin SDK
# needs credentials with elevated privileges.
#
# Choose ONE of the following methods:
#
# METHOD 1: JSON Object (Recommended for Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Studio)
# Paste the entire content of your service account JSON file here as a single-line string.
# Example: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type":"service_account", ...}'
# IMPORTANT: Be careful with quoting and escaping newlines (\n) inside the private key.
# A helper command to generate this: `jq -c . /path/to/your/service-account.json`
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=

# METHOD 2: File Path (Recommended for Docker, Cloud Run, local dev with file)
# The path to your service account JSON file. The Admin SDK will read this file.
# This is automatically configured in some Google Cloud environments.
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/service-account.json
